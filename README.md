Some visualizations and comments on observation.
********************************************************************************

Starting with analysis on the most affected country i.e. USA, they have recorded more than 9 million cases, that being the highest infected country in the world. As this study is concerned to location of city too, Houston is chosen from USA as it belongs to northern hemisphere i.e. in North America. As there were many hypotheses on temperature and effects of temperature on coronavirus spread, charts of temperature, wind speed and humidity will be visualized, furthermore there will correlation check among these selections. Houston is most populated city in Texas, and fourth most populated city in US. The temperature as shown in Fig. 1 ranges from average of 30° in May to average of 39° in July.

Furthermore, variation in wind speed and humidity is also observed in Fig 2 and Fig 3.
As it can be observed there’s been a constant high humidity presence during May to July, whereas wind speed keeping an average of 9 mph.

Figure 4 shows correlation in humidity, temperature and positive cases. As it can be seen from the charts, that there has been a small correlation that exists between number of cases per day while humidity decreases.

Chart below denotes, wind speed and positive cases which showed a non linear relationship.

Comparing the temperature to spread of virus, it showed a negative correlation in spread of virus and temperature.

Above charts shows, positive correlation in humidity whereas negative in wind speed and temperature. Making it evident that environment in northern hemisphere didn’t play much role in spread.


Other regions were also analyzed in the paper, leading to conclusion.

Conclusion-----
This study explored various location effected by coronavirus and weather effects on it. It can be influenced that coronavirus was identified across the world and it was observed from papers and observation that COVID-19 spread faster in cooler regions. There wasn’t much significant effect on the coronavirus due to weather conditions, but study showed positive correlation in humidity and virus spread. 
The study suggests proper management such as social distance, hand wash, compulsory masks to slow down the spread. Further, evident from observation that COVID-19 can diminish virus spread but other aspects has to be kept in mind to get full control on virus spread.
